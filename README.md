# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition---BI-Capstone

Task: To correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

Information about the dataset
Train.csv contains the label (actual digit) and pixels of the digit (28x28). We divide the data into train and test and run various algorithms to see which one gives highest accuracy.
